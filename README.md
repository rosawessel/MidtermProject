##  **About**
I am a sophomore pursuing a degree in Information Technology at the University of Missouri-Columbia. My areas of interest include Digital Media/Multimedia and Software Development; however, I am open to all areas of IT. I am intermediate in Python and HTML coding and have a thorough knowledge of game theory and design. I am interested in internship opportunities this summer and am willing to relocate. 
I want to immerse myself in the technology industry to learn new technology/software skills and gain hands-on experience. To deliver exceptional and accurate services to help others, I value effective communication to employ teamwork and collaboration with others. My experience adapting to work efficiently while under pressure in professional environments taught me the importance of being a valuable team player.
